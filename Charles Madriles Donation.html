                    <p>Dad was an amazing person, and there’s a void left here on earth with his departure. No matter what you called him, he always greeted you with a smile. He was full of life, full of joy.</p>
                
                        <p>Charlie was born in El Paso, Texas, in 1948 to Seferino and Teresa Madriles. He was the third child and shared his home with his siblings, Seferino Jr., Teresa, and Shirley. Dad was proud to be from Texas. He lived in Los Angeles for a short time and eventually moved to San Diego.  </p>
                
                             <p> Charlie joined the U.S. Army and fought in the Vietnam war. He endured tough times, and despite the turbulence that rose against him, he came out triumphant. War is never easy, but Dad didn’t let that change who he was. The war made him tougher not only physically but emotionally and spiritually. </p>
                
                
                                  <p> Dad was prepared for the next chapters of his life upon moving to San Diego, where he would meet and marry the love of his life, Rosalie. Charlie and Rosalie met in 1970 and married in 1973. They had a beautiful relationship that would last over 50 years. </p>
                
                                    <p> Together they have five children, Tony, Rachel, Carmelita, Teresa, and Christina. Charlie raised his family in National City and worked for many years as a machinist. Charlie’s family grew, and he had many wonderful nieces, nephews, and in-laws. Charlie also loved his grandchildren, Nadine, Carlos, Jesse, Alejandra, Armando, Alyssa, Isabella, and Baby Angel. </p>
                
                <p> Charlie was accepting, gracious, humble, loving, and joyful. He brought a smile to my heart and to all who knew him. It’s an honor to have shared my life with him. He was a great example of God’s love and lived his life being an example every day of his life.  </p>
                <p> We will see you one day in Heaven. See you later for now.</p>
